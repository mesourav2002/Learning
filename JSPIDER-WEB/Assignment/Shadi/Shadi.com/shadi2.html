                While you might find it impossible to know for sure whether your
                partner is serious about you, there are certain reassuring
                factors that are self-explanatory and reflect positively on the
                relationship. So consider this: You’ve met someone, and all your
                meetings and dates in person have been great so far. In fact,
                you both have connected pretty well and this infatuation period
                has given way to something a little more lasting. It could even
                lead to a permanent relationship except neither of you are
                really sure if it’s time to settle down. So, to make this
                decision easy here’s how to know if the relationship is getting
                serious.

                Of course, spending time with your partner is a must. But only
                happy couples enjoy that time together. So, if you love spending

                Friendship is crucial for the success of any relationship. With
                friendship comes a sense of understanding and comfort. And
                what’s the point of a relationship if you can’t be yourself
                around your partner? So, how well you get along and strengthen
                your friendship really shows that the relationship is not just

                If your partner has introduced you to their family and friends,

                them? And if not, would you still do it for your partner? All

                part of your life with mutual feelings on the other side, it
                means that you both are ready to take the next step and settle
